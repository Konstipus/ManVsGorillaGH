Hi I wanted to add some additional info in less formal manner.

I wanted to share other work I've done on Unreal. 

First off, a little game I coded and modeled myself, although far from being finished. Idea came to me when i was still learning, to start from 0 and not use any pre-made movement components. The game will require 2 gamepads or a keyboard + gamepad to test out properly.

And then my portfolio of VFX work, also composed in unreal, but spanning lots of software :)
